# Blugasm - A Bluetooth enabled Nogasm

This project aims to predict and detect orgasms by using a pressure sensor (and optionally, additional I2C sensors such as SpO2 and/or GSR sensor) while controlling a vibrator.

The original design and concept comes from the [nogasm](https://github.com/nogasm/nogasm). It improves upon it by making it battery operated and Bluetooth enabled, thanks to the ESP-32 microcontroller.
