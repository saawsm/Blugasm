# Blugasm - A Bluetooth enabled Nogasm

## About
This project aims to predict and detect orgasms by using a pressure sensor (and optionally a Heart-rate/SpO2 sensor) while controlling a vibrator.

The original design and concept comes from the [nogasm](https://github.com/nogasm/nogasm). It improves upon it by making it battery operated and Bluetooth enabled, thanks to the ESP-32 microcontroller.

## Acknowledgments
